# ManyPong 2

ManyPong is a pong-like game with a twist, there are multiple balls. ManyPong 2 is written in javascript and uses the p5.js framework. ManyPong 2 brings a new design update, bug fixes, and an entire rewrite of the program in p5.js. For building, see the Building section below.

## Building

ManyPong 2 brings in an entirely new build system from ManyPong 1. ManyPong uses mainly Webpack and Babel. With NPM, building is easy. First install the dependencies by running `npm install`. Then, by running `npm run build` HTML and JS files will be produced in the dist directory.

## Other Versions

If you're looking for other versions of ManyPong, here's a list:

* [ManyPong 1](https://github.com/MicMacro/ManyPong): The original version of ManyPong. Written in vanilla JS and HTML, it runs directly in your browser! Although good for historical purposes, ManyPong 2 holds many bug fixes and a much needed design update.
* [ManyPong for Mac](https://github.com/MicMacro/ManyPong): A version of ManyPong created specifically for macOS. Written in Apple's Swift using SpriteKit, ManyPong for Mac was created for the best possible ManyPong experience for macOS
